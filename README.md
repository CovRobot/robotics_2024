## Goal
Create a two-wheeled car driven by two brushless motors. It will be controlled via a computer
using arrow keys. The communication between the computer and the car will be accomplished
through the arduino platform and NRF24 transceivers. 


## To-Do
- power supply for car
- work on wiring (after testing functionality)
- design print and test frame for car
- write and test code for arduino communication
- write and test code for motor control
- test interplay between frontend and backend
- test interplay between arduino state communication and motor controll
- calibrate and fine tune
