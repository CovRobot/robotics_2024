# Robotics Club Project 2024 - Remote Control Car

## Goal:
Create a two-wheeled car driven by two brushless motors. It will be controlled via a computer
using arrow keys. The communication between the computer and the car will be accomplished
through the Arduino platform and NRF24 transceivers. 


## To-Do:
- power supply for car
- work on wiring (after testing functionality)
- design print and test frame for car
- write and test code for Arduino communication
- write and test code for motor control
- test interplay between frontend and backend
- test interplay between Arduino state communication and motor control
- calibrate and fine-tune
